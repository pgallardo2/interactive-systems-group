	    vacation I went to was to South Padre Island, Texas. I remember the
	    scent of the open water when I visited the beaches. I remember I ate at
	    this wonderful seafood restaurant. There, I had the best shrimp gumbo
	    you can possibly imagine. Have you been
	    on vacation lately?</dialog></event>

	    place I'd really like to visit is Germany. The rich history is a great
